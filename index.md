#### Web Design

I know a custom website can be unaffordable or unmanageable to individuals and
small businesses, but in {{ site.time | date: "%Y" }} it is crucial that
everyone have a presence on the internet. If you have a local business or
private practice, every day you wait without a website you lose potential
business.

That's where I can help! I am a computer science student at UNC. I make
beautiful and simple websites for anyone who wants to put their best face
forward. Email or call me and I will see what I can do for you!

##### Latest project
My most recent project can be found at <a href="https://chapelhillfriends.org">
chapelhillfriends.org</a>. The site required a full rewrite and content
migration in addition to a complete redesign. This was my largest project to
date, and I had a great time working with the wonderful people at the Chapel
Hill Friends Meeting!
