#### Info

I know tech support can be unaffordable or unmanageable to individuals and
small businesses, but in {{ site.time | date: "%Y" }} it is crucial that
everyone have access to working technology.

That's where I can help! I am a computer science student at UNC. I am very
good at solving technical issues, especially on Macintosh. Email or call me
and I will see what I can do for you.

#### Pricing

Since it doesn’t make sense to incentivize slow work, the fee is based on
the required task. The fee is $20 for me to come by and assess the problem;
then I can give you an estimate. I prefer cash or Venmo.

As an example, if you need help updating an old Macbook, it might be as simple
as finding the proper version and installing; however, if the computer has not
been updated in a while, various systems and credentials might need to be
updated as well. I won’t know what needs to be done until I see the system in
question, but then I can give a cost estimate based on what will be needed.
